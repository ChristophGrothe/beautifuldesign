    <h1>A collection of nice, beautiful things...</h1>
  <div class="intro">
  <p class="intro-p">Hi, I'm Chris and I am going to become a frontend developer and webdesigner. I love beautiful things and whenever I see something beautiful, I try to take a photo. However, mostly I don't have a real use for this photos. But I don't want them to be forgotten in a folder in the cloud. And so I came to the idea: Why not creating an own website for them. Maybe as kind of a artistic project. I the best case, somebody finds some inspiration looking through it.</p>

  <p class="subtext cartext">This is a fast food car which you can find in Graz every friday night. Actually it's (with all the lights on it) the first beautiful fast food car I have seen in my life.</p> 
  <p class="subtext fanbooktext"> I know, this websites looks maybe more like a Harry Potter fansite then a "beautiful-picture"-fansite. This is cause at the moment I indeed have my "Harry Potter"-phasis. However, I really find a lot of Harry Potter stuff (like this book-cover) really beautiful :)</p>
  <p class="subtext shoptext"> This is a (as you maybe can see) quite small shop in Graz. They offer diverse tasty things to eat. The owner, a young women from abroad, once told me, everything costs 3.50€ per 100g. I guess, meanwhile it will be more.</p>

  <p class="subtext neontext">Beautiful websites are another thing next to pictures which I "collect" and wanna post here. And I love the design of this site (CSS-tricks) as well as neon lights</p>
  <img class="coffee border" src="https://github.com/ChristophGrothe/wonderful/blob/main/coffee.jpg?raw=true" width="55%" height="auto">
  <p class="subtext coffeetext">This is a - as you can see- very tiny coffee near the place where I live. I never sit in there but it catched my eyes when I walked along there.</p>
  <a class="plnts" href="www.plnts.com"><img class="border" src="https://github.com/ChristophGrothe/wonderful/blob/main/plants.png?raw=true" width="75%" height="auto">
  </a>--&gt;
<p class="subtext plntstext">www.plnts.com is a website which you can only love if you love plants. I guess they left out the "a" cause there's also a site called "www.plants.com" (which is also great) - and I think the guys from "plants" will have been faster.</p>
<img class="lama border" src="https://github.com/ChristophGrothe/wonderful/blob/main/Dalai%20Lama.png?raw=true" width="60%" height="auto">
<p class="subtext lamatext">Creating this website I have one little problem: Most book covers that I took a photo from are Harry Potter- related. However this should not be a Harry Potter site. This Dalai Lama cover is one of the few book covers I have which are not HP-related.</p>
  <img class="chess border" src="https://github.com/ChristophGrothe/wonderful/blob/main/chess.jpg?raw=true" width="95%" height="auto"> 
  <p class="subtext chesstext">I don't play chess, however I find chess can look really nice. Especially in computer visualizations like this here.</p>
